# SME Financial Inclusion Project

## Overview
The SME Financial Inclusion Project aims to enhance the accessibility of financial services for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This repository features two key components:

Credit Score Prediction System: An intelligent model designed to predict the credit scores of SMEs based on financial data, facilitating better decision-making for financial institutions and SMEs.
SME Information Chatbot: An advanced chatbot that provides detailed information on SME-related queries, leveraging the power of natural language processing and online resources.
Features

Credit Score Prediction: Helps financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of SMEs by analyzing their financial metrics.
Information Retrieval: The chatbot assists users by fetching and delivering information on SME policies, loan processes, and more, making it easier for SMEs to navigate financial services.
Scalable and Extensible: The project is built to be scalable, with potential for integration with other financial tools and services.
